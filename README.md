The CS 61 series is an introduction to computer science, with particular emphasis on software and machines from a programmer's point of view.

CS 61A concentrates on the idea of abstraction, allowing the programmer to think in terms appropriate to the problem rather than in low-level operations dictated by the computer hardware.
CS 61B will deal with the more advanced engineering aspects of software, such as constructing and analyzing large programs.
CS 61C concentrates on machines and how they carry out the programs you write.
In CS 61A, we are interested in teaching you about programming, not about how to use one particular programming language. We consider a series of techniques for controlling program complexity, such as functional programming, data abstraction, and object-oriented programming.

61A primarily uses the Python 3 programming language. Python is a popular language in both industry and academia. It is also particularly well-suited to the task of exploring the topics taught in this course. We will also examine the Scheme programming language in the second half of the course.

Mastery of a particular programming language is a useful side effect of 61A. However, our hope is that once you have learned the essence of programming, you will find that picking up a new programming language is but a few days' work.
